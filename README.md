# Wine Data Application

The purpose of project is to create a working GUI where a company could safely have their employees log in and either register new users, view data statistics, or find information about the company. The wine data is in a CSV file, and the database containing the user accounts is processed using SQLite3 with python. The GUI is coded using PYQT and a subclass of the code containing the the layout contains the logic and controls.

The project is ongoing, data visualization tools and project folder structure need work, so excuse the lack of structure in the file.

File needed to run is Complete.py. Packages/libraries required are PyQT5, searborn, sqlite3, matplotlib, pandas, sys and scipy.stats.
